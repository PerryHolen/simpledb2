--Predicate.java
In Predicate, I keep track of 3 member variables, the field number, fieldNo, 
operator, and operand. The constructor, and getters are relatively
straightforward. To filter I use the operand's compare method in combination 
with the operator, and the tuple's tupleNo'th field. 

--JoinPredicate.java
Here my member variables are the two field numbers and an operator.
I then filter by comparing the two corresponding fields aquired 
by the fieldNo  members.

---Filter.java
HEre I keep store a predicate, a child, and an array of children. 
To fetchNext, I continue along the iterator using next, and if 
one of the tuples passes the filter, I return it.
